# IronModelMicroalgae
The present repository has example code for using iron co-limitation model on heterotrophic microalgae growth

This ilustrates an example of the iron co-limitation model in which iron is added during the exponential phase of C.sorokiniana.

In this repository are presented the next following scripts intended for:

- Cond_Init_modelo (Introduce initial conditions)
- Param_modelo (Introduce kinetic paramaters regarding the model)
- Iron_CoLimitation_Model (Model the iron co-limitation effect on growth and substrate consumption kinetics)

The above are part of the supplementary material of the following researchh work:

Strategy for Managing Industrial Anaerobic Sludge through the Heterotrophic Cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana: Effect of Iron Addition on Biomass and Lipid Production
